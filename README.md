# Pitchfork Music Recommender using Spotify

## Overview

Recommending Pitchfork-Reviewed Albums & Songs using Usersâ€™ Spotify Music Libraries. We don't have time to read through and try all albums and songs that music journalists review on websites like [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/). We introduce a recommendation system that gives users with Pitchfork reviewed music recommendations tailored to their specific tastes based on their recent Spotify libraries.
